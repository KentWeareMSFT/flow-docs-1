# Responding to GDPR Data Subject Export Requests for Microsoft Flow

As part of our commitment to partner with you on your journey to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we’ve developed documentation to help you prepare. The documentation not only describes what we’re doing to prepare for the GDPR but also shares examples of steps you can take today with Microsoft to support GDPR compliance when using Microsoft Flow.

## Manage Export requests

The *right of data portability* allows a data subject to request a copy of their personal data in an electronic format (that’s a “structured, commonly used, machine readable, and interoperable format”) that may be transmitted to another data controller.

Microsoft Flow offers the following experiences to find or export personal data for a specific user:

* **Website access:** sign into the [PowerApps Admin Center](https://admin.powerapps.com/), or the [Microsoft Flow Admin Center](https://admin.flow.microsoft.com/).

* **PowerShell access:**  [PowerApps Admin PowerShell cdmlets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871804).

## Export a flow

Either an end user or an administrator, who has granted themselves access to the flow, can export the flow by following these steps:

1. Sign into [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

1. Select the **My flows** link, and then select the flow to export.

1. Select **… More**, and then select **Export**.

    ![Export flow](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/export-flow.png)

1. Select **Package (.zip)**.

Your flow will now be available as a zipped package. For more information, see the blog post about [how to export and import a flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/import-export-bap-packages/).

## Export run history

Run history includes a list of all executions that have occurred for a flow. This data includes the flow’s status, start time, duration, and input/output data for triggers and actions.

Either an end user or an administrator, who has been granted access to the flow through the Microsoft Flow Admin Center, can follow these steps to export this data:

1. Sign into [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/).
1. Select the **My flows** link, and then select the flow for which you want to export the run history.
1. In the **RUN HISTORY** pane, select **See all**.

    ![Run history](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/run-history.png)

1. Select **Download CSV**.

    ![Download CSV](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/download-csv.png)

The run history is downloaded as a .csv file so that you can open it in Microsoft Excel or a text editor and further analyze the results.

## Export a user's activity feed

In [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com/), the activity feed shows a user’s history of activities, failures and notifications. Any user can view their activity feed by following these steps:

1. Sign into [Microsoft Flow](http://flow.microsoft.com/), select the bell icon near the upper-right corner, and then select **Show all activity**.

    ![Show activity feed](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/show-activity-feed.png)

1. In the **Activity** screen, copy the results, and then paste them into a document editor such as Microsoft Word.

## Export a user’s connections

Connections allow flows to connect to APIs, SaaS applications, and other third-party systems. Follow these steps to view your connections:

1. Sign into [Microsoft Flow](http://flow.microsoft.com/), select the gear icon near the upper-right corner, and then select **Connections**.

    ![Show Connections](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/show-connections.png)
1. Copy the results, and then paste them into a document editor such as Microsoft Word.

## Export a list of a user’s connection permissions

A user can export the connection role assignments for all connection that they have access to via the Get-ConnectionRoleAssignment function in the [PowerApps PowerShell cdmlets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871804).

## Export a user’s custom connectors

Custom connectors supplement the out of box connectors and allow for connectivity to other APIs, SaaS, and custom-developed systems. You can transfer ownership of a custom connector or delete it.

Follow these steps to export a list of customer connectors:

1. Navigate to [Microsoft Flow](https://flow.microsoft.com).
1. Select the settings **gear** icon.
1. Select **Custom Connectors**.
1. Copy and paste the list of custom connectors into a text editor such as Microsoft Word.

    ![Export custom connectors](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/export-custom-connectors.png)

In addition to the experience provided in Microsoft Flow, you can use the Get-Connector function from the [PowerApps PowerShell cmdlets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871804) to export all custom connectors.

## Export a user’s custom connector permissions

A user can export all custom connector permissions they have created via the Get-ConnectorRoleAssignment function in the [PowerApps PowerShell cdmlets](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=871804).

![Export custom connector permissions powershell](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/export-connector-permissions.png)

## Export approval history

Microsoft Flow Approvals History captures a historical record of approvals that have been received or sent for a user. Any user can view their approval history by:

1. Signing into [Microsoft Flow](http://flow.microsoft.com/), selecting **Approvals**, and then selecting **History**.

    ![View approval history](./media/gdpr-dsr-export/view-approval-history.png)

1. A list shows approvals that the user received. The users can show approvals that they sent by selecting the down arrow next to **Received** and then selecting **Sent**.
