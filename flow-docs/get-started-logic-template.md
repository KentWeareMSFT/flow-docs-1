# Create a flow from a template in Microsoft Flow
Create a flow from one of many built-in templates that can, for example, send you a Slack message when your manager sends you an email in Office 365.

**Note:** [Create a flow from scratch](get-started-logic-flow.md) if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it.

**Prerequisites**

* An account on [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com)
* A Slack account
* Office 365 credentials

## Choose a template

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), select **Templates** in the top navigation bar.
2. In the search bar, type **Slack**, and then select the search icon.
3. You'll see only templates related to Slack, so you can now select **Send a message on Slack when my manager emails me**.

4. Confirm that this template will do what you want, and then select **Use this template**.
5. If you aren't signed into Office or Slack, select **Sign in** and then follow the prompts.
   
    ![List of connections that the template requires](./media/get-started-logic-template/confirm-connections.png)
6. After you confirm your connections, select **Continue**.
   
    Your flow appears, showing each action with an orange title bar.
   
    ![Default events and actions from template](./media/get-started-logic-template/template-default.png)

## Customize your flow
1. Select the title bar for an event to expand it, and then customize it (for example, by specifying a filter on the email that interests you).
2. Actions that require input from you will automatically be expanded.
   
    For example, the **Post message** action is expanded because you need to enter a channel, such as your *\@username*. You can also customize the message content. By default, the message will contain just the subject, but you can include other information.
   
    ![Specify channel for slack](./media/get-started-logic-template/specify-keyword.png)
3. Near the top of the screen, specify a name for your flow, and then select **Create flow**.
4. Finally, if you're happy with your flow, select **Done**.
   
    ![Done button](./media/get-started-logic-template/done.png)

Now, when your manager sends you an email, you'll receive a Slack message that contains the information that you specified.
