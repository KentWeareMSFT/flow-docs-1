Starting with Microsoft Flow, as an individual, is easy! Before you can create a flow, sign up by using any email address. If you've never used an online Microsoft product with that address, you'll need to take a few moments to register it.

## Sign up free
If you haven't used other online Microsoft products, you'll need to sign up.

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), click or tap **Sign up free** in the upper-right corner.
2. Enter your email address.
3. Click or tap the right arrow.

## Sign in
If you've used other Microsoft online products, either for work or yourself, all you need to do is sign in.

1. In [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com), click or tap **Sign in** in the upper-right corner.

2. Enter your email address.
3. On the sign-in page, enter your email address and password.

## Using paid features
Anyone can sign up and get a free plan for Microsoft Flow. If your organization has purchased Office 365 or Dynamics 365 for you, you may have access to additional features for Microsoft Flow. You can also start a 90-day free trial or purchase Microsoft Flow Plan 1 or Plan 2 if you would like to use the paid features. [Learn more about billing](billing-questions.md).

For administration information, see [Flows in your organization Q&A](organization-q-and-a.md).

## Troubleshooting
In many cases, you can register for Microsoft Flow by following the simple process described earlier in this topic. However, this table summarizes the most common reasons why you may not be able to sign up and describes available workarounds.

For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com, but your ID might be nancys@contoso.com. To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to you for signing in to Office 365 or other Microsoft services. |

## Next steps
* [Start with a template](get-started-logic-template.md), which is a pre-built flow that's set up for you.
* [Start from blank](get-started-logic-flow.md) if you already have a process in mind and can't find a template for it.
